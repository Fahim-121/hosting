    <h1>Are HTML and CSS the same as other coding languages?</h1>

    <p>In the world of web development, you’ll come across a whole ream of different languages used for programming – like <b>Java, Ruby, Python, SQL, and Perl</b>. These five programming languages are actually in the bracket of what’s known as back-end development programming languages. Javascript, HTML, and CSS are in the bracket of front-end development.</p>

    <i>With so many different programming languages to choose from, you’ll find it tricky when it comes to choosing a programming language. However, an initial understanding of what the different programming languages are used for will be beneficial in deciding which one you choose to learn. </i><br><br>

    <strong>You’ll likely see many people decrying the fact that HTML and CSS are lumped in with other coding languages and tell you that they aren’t actually proper coding languages themselves. And while they might not be quite as flexible as other coding languages, especially in terms of their practical possibilities, they’re both highly specialised languages that can do really interesting things.</strong> 

    <p>The main reason why HTML and CSS aren’t considered programming languages is because they only determine the structure and the style of the webpage you’re building. They don’t contain any instructions like the other front-end languages.</p>
